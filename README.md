Project Description: Multi-Layer Authentication Framework Using Behavioral Biometrics

This project focuses on developing a multi-layer authentication system integrating behavioral biometrics (keystroke dynamics) to prevent account takeover (ATO) fraud in online banking systems. By analyzing typing patterns such as dwell time, flight time, and typing speed, the system authenticates users based on their unique behavioral signatures.  

The project incorporates machine learning (Isolation Forest) for anomaly detection, allowing the system to detect fraudulent login attempts in real-time. The backend is built using PHP and MySQL, with a JavaScript-powered frontend for capturing keystroke data. Website logs and datasets were used for training and evaluating the model, ensuring accurate fraud detection.  

Key features include passive user authentication, multi-layered security, and real-time anomaly detection, offering enhanced security while maintaining a seamless user experience. This solution aims to safeguard online banking systems from common cyber threats like credential stuffing, phishing, and brute force attacks.
